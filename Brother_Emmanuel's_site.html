         <p1> My name is Brother Emmanuel, I am a mininster of ther Gospel. 
             For this reason I was born; to bring people into their inheritnace 
             promised in Faith in Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus has called 
             and assigned me as according to Acts 26:18 "To open their eyes, 
            and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, 
            that they may receive forgiveness of sins, 
            and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me." Well, I am fully convinced 
        of this commission because: first He has said  this in many references. To mention a few;</p1>
        
        <ul>
            <li> In here Jesus actually sent all of us, and he claimed us to 
                have become teachers of the Nations. 
                Matthew 28:18-20 "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, 
                All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
                Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, 
                baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
                Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: 
                and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen."
            </li>
            <li>In this occasion, Lord Jesus says that the very assignment the Father had given Him
                He is now giving us. And actually He us the very same enablement He had, that is the Spirit 
                of God. John 20:21-22 "Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: 
                as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
                And when he had said this, he breathed on them, 
                and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:"
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p2>That was my first argument, here is my second one: the Spirit of God has taught me 
            how to accomplish this purpose. In as musch I have a lot to learn, i still confess of 
            His love and patience with which He raised me to this point. The Gift of Knowlegde and understanding
            His wonderful word made me a wonder to my world. I thought of what word would summarize all
            of the deas which were running thruogh my mind, I remembered David: The Lord has made me a wonder

                     Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth <strong>(Philippians 2:9-10).</strong>          
                </p1>

            <p1 class = "ROR_paragraph">
                Jesus is head over all things; He’s the head of all principality and power. His Name has power in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth. Everything responds to His Name. Demons bow to His Name and scamper in terror; contrary circumstances are changed at the mention of His Name.
            <br></p1>  
    
            <p1 class = "ROR_paragraph">
                You have to learn to honour His Name for its power to work for you, in you, and through you. Your result, or how much that Name works for you is to the extent that you honour it. Honour, primarily, means to show respect to, towards or for. Honouring the Name of Jesus means giving recognition to Him, and serving Him as Lord. His Name only works for those who honour Him as Lord.
            <br></p1>

            <p1 class = "ROR_paragraph">
                For instance, there’re sinners who agree that the Name of Jesus is the greatest Name, but they don’t serve Him; they aren’t following Him. As a result, the Name isn’t working for them. In the same way, as a Christian, you have to be subject to the Lord Jesus. Honour Him in your life for His Name to work for you. God said in 1 Samuel 2:30, “…them that honour me I will honour….” Jesus said, “…if any man serve me, him will my father honour” (John 12:26).

                What a privilege to use the holy, majestic, awesome Name of the Lord Jesus, the One that’s greater than all, and to whom everything in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth bows. Today, and always, I adore and uphold the glory of your Name, and with reverence, I declare that you’re the Living God, holy, gracious and true. Amen.
